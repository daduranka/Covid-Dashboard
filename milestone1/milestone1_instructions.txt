To run the ScrapeWebsite.py module you must have pandas, BeautifulSoup, and requests installed on your machine. 

pip install commands for each module:

BeautifulSoup: pip install beautifulsoup4
pandas: pip install pandas
requests: pip install requests

Once these modules are installed you can simply run the ScrapeWebsite.py to get today's covid information for the usa.

If the data for a different region is desired then the scrape_country function can be called again following the pattern below:

name_of_country = scrape_country('name_of_country')

The return value is a .csv file that contains the raw and normalized data for the country scraped.
