# Covid-Dashboard

Class: ME EN 6250
Students: Eli Finlinson, Braden Brown

This repository contains the code for the ME EN 6250 Covid Dashboard assignment. The goal of this code is to allow users to compare the covid data between different countries. This goal is accomplished by creating a website of interactive plots using the python and the Bokeh library. The general process will be scraping data from websites and then plotting the data to the website.
